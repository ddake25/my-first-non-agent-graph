## Why this repo exists

This is my first hands-on experiment using [LangGraph](https://langgraph.dev) â€” a graph-based framework for structured AI workflows. Unlike agent-based architectures, this simple graph has one node and showcases how state updates work.

It's built to demonstrate my understanding of:

- Custom state management in LangGraph
- stateful workflows
- Graph compilation and execution in LangChain-style frameworks

I'm exploring this to build more advanced AI workflows in the near future ðŸš€
